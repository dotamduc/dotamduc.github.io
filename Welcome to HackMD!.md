## Workspace & sidebar
Whenever you sign into your HackMD account, you'll be greeted by a workspace. Everything you do in HackMD takes place in a workspace. Think of this as your homebase, where you can create new notes, jump back into existing ones, change your settings -- anything you need to stay organized and create with ease.

Whether just yourself or together as a team, every workspace consists of a sidebar and note list. The note list takes up the bulk of the page. Here is where you'll find all your notes. On the sidebar, you'll find...

### Sidebar
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S126WKlo0.png =300x)

1. Toggle to switch between personal and team workspaces.
2. Keyword search bar.
3. "New note" button.
5. Trash (notes permanently delete after 3 days in the trash).
6. List of tags (these help you filter your notes).
7. List of all bookmarked notes.
8. List of recently viewed notes.

>[!Tip] Personal vs team sidebar 
>Your team workspace sidebar may look a little different, depending on your permissions within that specific workspace.

## Personal workspace
Your personal workspace is your domain. A place where you can record daily activities, write study notes, brainstorm -- anything you'd like! This is your space. Only you have access.

Your personal workspace is also where you can manage your account. 

### Account management

Every personal workspace has...

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SycrjDw-yx.png =300x)

1. Account settings.
2. Personal profile page (this is your public page).
3. A list of all the teams you've joined.
4. Billing settings.
5. A space to...
	- Change your language preference.
	- Contact the HackMD team.
	- View the Terms of Use.

## Create a note
Creating your first note takes only a few seconds.

1. Click the "New note" button at the top of the sidebar to create a note.
2. Once your note opens, you can give it a title, create a document tag, and begin jotting down ideas.

>[!Tip] Document tags help you organize your work.
>Organize your documents into groups, keeping your workspace organized and docs easy to find.

Eager to start customizing your note? Like other editing platforms, you can click the toolbar buttons to apply text effects. Bold, italics, bullet points, and tables can all be used with a single click.

## Start with a template
To help you get started with HackMD, we've created a host of templates you can use as a jumping-off point for your notes.

1. To get started, click &nbsp; <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true"></i> &nbsp; and then &nbsp;"New note from template."
2. From there, you can view our full list of templates. These cover a number of different purposes, which you can use as a starting point or for inspiration. 
3. Once you decide on the template, click "Use this template" to open it as a note.

**Here are a few of our favorite templates:**
- 📑 Project README
- 🛠️ Product Brief
- 🖋️ Meeting Minutes
- 🎨 Design specs

## Insert images & gifs
You can enrich your notes by inserting project images, offline event photos, or demonstration GIFs.

There are two main ways to upload images: 
1. Choose the image you want to insert by clicking `🖼️` in the toolbar.
2. Drag and drop the file into the note editor.
    ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJxGFDvZJg.png =400x)

We support the following formats for images and gifs: PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP, and TIF.

You can add attributes after the image link to specify the image size (i.e. ` =300x` or ` =50%`).

## Comments
Commenting is the easiest way to give or receive feedback directly in your notes.

There are two main ways to leave a comment:

1. Select a piece of text in any note.
![圖片](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk3_JUob1l.png)
2. Click the comment panel.
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJRxyCQFR.png =300x)

Along with leaving comments about the overall note, the comment panel allows you to view and interact with all the note comments. You can even tag another teammate in a comment by @-mentioning them.

Want to delete or resolve a comment? Click the three dots on the upper right-hand side to expand the menu. From there, click your desired action.

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJGKTztvR.png =300x)

You can always re-open resolved comments by clicking on the comment panel `💬` at the top of the page and then the "*Marked as Resolved*" button. From there, click the three dots next to the comment you'd like to re-open and "Revert resolved".

## Suggest edit
Suggest Edit allows you to suggest edits to content you're working with others on -- correct typos, suggest better wording, or even create a to-do list. 

First, you'll want to make sure this feature is turned on within your note. To do that, simply...

1. Open the "Share" menu in the upper right-hand corner.
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1uSCa7tC.png =300x)
2. Click "More features" to confirm the comment setting and suggest edits are =="on."==
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJdwRpXYR.png =300x)
3. This is also the area to confirm who is allowed to comment and make edits to your note.

From there suggesting edits is fairly straightforward. Like creating a comment, to suggest an edit select a piece of text within your note and then click "Suggest edit".

### Where to find the suggestions?
All the suggested edits will live in the edit panel. To find that, click the 💬 at the top right of the note. From there, click "Comments" to activate the drop-down bar. 

This will show you all the current suggestions, as well as any previously addressed suggestions.

## Share & set permissions
HackMD is built for real-time collaboration, so there are many ways to share your work with others.

Permissioning with the notes ensures that your collaborators access your content exactly the way you want them to. 

### Share button
Click the "Share" button at the top right-hand corner of your note. Here you can:
1. Invite someone to your note.
2. See and change who has access to the note, and what level of permissions they have.
3. Edit the note's permalink.
4. Copy the note's link to share it with others.
5. Publish your note. (We'll discuss this one later.)
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy42iZm30.png =150x)

### Link / Permalink
At the top of the Share menu is the note's URL or link.

Here's where you can edit that link, as well as copy it for easy sharing.

### Note Permission
Once that's set, underneath you'll find the "Note Permission" section. That can be set for those who will be reading your note and those writing in it. 

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1ptpZXh0.png =300x)
>[!Caution] 
>Once the reading permission is set to "Everyone," there are no restrictions on individuals or team members. No matter who gets the link, anyone can read it. 

### Invitee
At the bottom of the "Share" menu, you'll find the Invitee section. This is where you can invite individual HackMD users to your note -- **invitees need a HackMD account to be invited to your note**.

## Publishing

1. Open the "Share" menu 
2. Switch to the "Publish" tab.
3. Ensure compliance with and agree to the [HackMD Community Guidelines](https://hackmd.io/@hackmd/community-guidelines?utm_source=prepopulatednote&utm_medium=editor&utm_campaign=beginnertutorial&utm_content=tutorial)
