With our Markdown editor, you and your team can edit, share, and discuss your documents in real-time.\nThroughout this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk through everything you need to know about the Markdown editor and how you can use HackMD to its fullest.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get started!\nWhat we\u0026rsquo;ll cover\r#\rWorkspace \u0026amp; sidebar Personal workspace Create a note Start with a template Insert images \u0026amp; gifs Comments Suggest edit Share \u0026amp; set permissions Publishing Further learning Workspace \u0026amp; sidebar\r#\rWhenever you sign into your HackMD account, you\u0026rsquo;ll be greeted by a workspace. Everything you do in HackMD takes place in a workspace. Think of this as your homebase, where you can create new notes, jump back into existing ones, change your settings \u0026ndash; anything you need to stay organized and create with ease.\nWhether just yourself or together as a team, every workspace consists of a sidebar and note list. The note list takes up the bulk of the page. Here is where you\u0026rsquo;ll find all your notes. On the sidebar, you\u0026rsquo;ll find\u0026hellip;\nSidebar\r#\r![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S126WKlo0.png =300x)\nToggle to switch between personal and team workspaces.

List of recently viewed notes. [!Tip] Personal vs team sidebar Your team workspace sidebar may look a little different, depending on your permissions within that specific workspace.\nPersonal workspace\r#\rYour personal workspace is your domain. A place where you can record daily activities, write study notes, brainstorm \u0026ndash; anything you\u0026rsquo;d like! This is your space. Only you have access.\nYour personal workspace is also where you can manage your account.\nAccount management\r#\rEvery personal workspace has\u0026hellip;\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SycrjDw-yx.png =300x)\nAccount settings.

View the Terms of Use. Create a note\r#\rCreating your first note takes only a few seconds.\nClick the \u0026ldquo;New note\u0026rdquo; button at the top of the sidebar to create a note. Once your note opens, you can give it a title, create a document tag, and begin jotting down ideas. ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hkz8jJbK0.png =300x)\n[!Tip] Document tags help you organize your work. Organize your documents into groups, keeping your workspace organized and docs easy to find.\nEager to start customizing your note? Like other editing platforms, you can click the toolbar buttons to apply text effects. Bold, italics, bullet points, and tables can all be used with a single click.\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJF1uvPZye.png =550x)\nAnd if you\u0026rsquo;re searching for a specific Markdown function, click on the ? to view a Markdown syntax cheat sheet. ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1zruPD-Jx.png =300x)\nWe value your feedback!\r#\rDid you find this guide helpful?

These cover a number of different purposes, which you can use as a starting point or for inspiration. Once you decide on the template, click \u0026ldquo;Use this template\u0026rdquo; to open it as a note. ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ8mYiWaC.png =300x) Here are a few of our favorite templates:\nüìë Project README üõ†Ô∏è Product Brief üñãÔ∏è Meeting Minutes üé® Design specs Insert images \u0026amp; gifs\r#\rYou can enrich your notes by inserting project images, offline event photos, or demonstration GIFs.\nThere are two main ways to upload images:\nChoose the image you want to insert by clicking üñºÔ∏è in the toolbar.

From there suggesting edits is fairly straightforward. Like creating a comment, to suggest an edit select a piece of text within your note and then click \u0026ldquo;Suggest edit\u0026rdquo;.\nWhere to find the suggestions?\r#\rAll the suggested edits will live in the edit panel. To find that, click the üí¨ at the top right of the note.
